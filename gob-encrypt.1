.TH GOB-ENCRYPT  "1"
.SH NAME
gob-encrypt \- Encrypt data read from stdin and write it to stdout
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gob-encrypt (\-\-version | <KEY>)
.SH DESCRIPTION
gob-encrypt reads data from stdin, encrypts it with a key and writes the ciphertext to stdout.
The output will be in multiples of the block size specified at compile time, such that no length information about a specific encrypted block is leaked.
The encryption uses an authenticated secret key mechanism, such that tampering with the data can be detected after the fact.
